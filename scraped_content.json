Machine learning: building on the “Data Analytics” course proposed in the first semester, students will learn the basics of supervised machine learning such as SVM, linear classifiers, deep learning, and Bayesian inference. At the same time, students will be asked to complete a group project in 5 weeks, selecting one of the techniques presented during the course and implementing it (typical example: a classification problem). 2. Reasoning: the second part of the course will cover classical AI techniques such as exploration and search algorithms, game playing, and constraint satisfaction. A set of exercises to be solved individually on paper will be proposed, as well as a second project based on modeling and solving a constraint satisfaction problem, with the objective of winning the end-of-course tournament. Each part of the course lasts for 6 weeks, with the first 2 weeks dedicated to lectures by the teachers, and the remaining weeks consisting of tutoring sessions in the lab and student presentations. These two aspects are completed with an introductory session on AI in the form of a world coffee and two lectures on the history and ethics in AI.\nPrerequisites: The courses of Advanced Programming and Data Analytics in semester 1.\nCompetences Acquired: The purpose of this course is to provide students with a broad overview of different techniques in AI, focusing on machine learning and reasoning with two separate projects. In implementing different techniques, students will get first-hand experience with AI and a detailed knowledge about certain techniques (objective 1). By explaining their choice of technique, and comparing it with other options presented during the course, students will also acquire a broad knowledge of AI tools and a critical approach to their practical application (objective 2). The projects will use classification and scheduling as mediums to test and explore algorithms, which will expose students to the major challenges and common benchmarks used in modern AI. The two projects will be developed in Python programming language, which the students will need to learn adapting their knowledge of Java to a new language (objective 3).\nRough Program: Week 1 – 2 lectures. World coffee on AI, introduction to machine learning, data representation, unsupervised learning (k-means, clustering), separability. Presentation of first project., Week 2 – 4 lectures. Supervised learning, regression and gradient descent, Bayesian models, SVMs, boosting, perceptron, backpropagation, kernels, neural networks, deep learning., Week 3 – 1 lecture and 1 supervision session. Ethics and AI: data., Week 4 – 3hrs project supervision., Week 5 – 3hrs project supervision., Week 6 – project deadline and 1h30 presentations by the groups., Week 7 – 3 lectures. Exploration and search algorithms, computational complexity, non-informed search., WINTER BREAK, Week 8 – 4 lectures. A* and informed search, heuristics, local/global optima. Game trees (MINMAX and alpha/beta pruning). Constraint satisfaction and constraint programming., Week 9 – Supervision session + Ethics and AI (the job market) + exercises check., Week 10 – 3hrs project supervision., Week 11 – 3hrs project supervision., Week 12 – project deadline and 1h30 presentation + tournament., Projects will be done in groups of 3. For the first project, a different technique needs to be picked by each group, to make sure that all techniques covered in class gets implemented. Individual reports need to be handed in comparing the techniques developed with the other ones presented in class. Guidelines on the project supervision will be provided together with the project description. \nEvaluation Method: Continuous assessment: a minimum of two examinations, of which at least one evaluating each individual student. Students will receive a project grade and an exam grade: 1. Two group projects and individual exercises (40% of final grade): the evaluation will take into consideration the performance of the algorithm developed by the students with respect to a benchmark given by the teachers, as well as with respect to the algorithms proposed by other groups; the quality of the code and the difficulty of the algorithm implemented; the student participation in the tutoring sessions; the individual report detailing the choice of techniques done by the group and an individual assessment and justification of these choices. 2. Final written examination (60% of final grade): two or more exercises will be proposed in a 3-hour long written exam, on machine learning and on reasoning. Students will have to choose and describe the appropriate techniques they would implement to solve the problem, analyse such methods with the techniques learned in class, propose innovative combinations of known techniques, and justify their choice with respect to the other techniques presented in class.\nSpecific Course Rules: not mentioned\nCourse Material: Course slides, exercises and past exams available on the online platform https://cours.ut-capitole.fr/course/view.php?id=10050\nBibliography Webography: Russell and Norvig.

Reading, understanding, and presenting scientific papers (Activity 1): each student will pick one article from a set proposed by a teacher, and prepares a short presentation (15-20 minutes) to explain it to the group, contextualising it to a particular problem. 2. Interview with researchers (Activity 2): each student selects a researcher in Toulouse who works in the topic of the scientific paper chosen, and interview her/him on the latest finding in her/his field, her/his motivation to become a researcher, and her/his connections to industry. 3. Conceiving and writing a group position paper (Activity 2): four groups of students will research on four topics (privacy, job market, inequalities, warfare), producing each a position paper and a final presentation suggesting policies to tackle the social consequences of innovation in IT. 4. Individual presentations (Activity 3): topics can be proposed by single students on the discussion platform and can be voted by the other students. Once a month the most voted proposal is selected and a 30 minutes individual presentation is prepared by the student behind the proposal.\nCompetences Acquired: Innovation in information technology goes fast. The techniques and softwares learned during a master programme can quickly be outdated – some would even argue that when a technology gets to the classroom it is already outdated. To be able to function effectively in a rapidly changing technological environment, you need to be able to understand the relevance of scientific papers to the problems you will be facing, comprehend the structure and the functioning of scientific research, and communicate your findings to the rest of your team (Objective 1). Innovation in IT is affecting more and more our societies, and companies and public bodies will soon need to take a stance on the social consequences of innovative information technologies, such as the disappearance of privacy and the transformation of the job market. The second objective of this course is to make you aware of these social transformations, by learning how to construct and defend a solid opinion, and making recommendations for future policies (Objective 2). Finally, the third objective is to learn how to work in a team, putting in practice what is being learned in the soft skills course (Objective 3). Critical thoughts and constructive attitude will be encouraged.\nEvaluation Method: Students will be evaluated according to the following three criteria: Individual presentation and reports (evaluating Objective 1), evaluated by the teacher (40% of final grade). Participation in group activities (evaluating Objective 1 and 2), evaluated by the teachers and the students with peer-grading on Spliddit.org (40%). Participation in class, to the webpage and the sharing platform (evaluating Objective 3), evaluated by the teacher with the help of a tool proposed by the students (20%).\nSpecific Course Rules: not mentioned"

Indexing strategies for optimizing data retrieval are also reviewed. Many lab sessions allow students to get know-how on the Cloudera CDH distribution, Oracle and SQL Server. A week-long project concludes this course.\nPrerequisites: Basics in Java programming and more generally Object Oriented Programming. Students should also know the Relational data model, data models used in Business Intelligence and the SQL query language.\nCompetences Acquired: The purpose of this course is to identify the techniques for managing high volumes of data. At the end students should be able to: Understand how these techniques allow to improve performances, fault tolerance and scalability; Select a proper architecture or tool to analyse high volumes of data efficiently; Write parallel programs for analysing data using languages from different abstraction levels such as Map/Reduce in Java over Hadoop, Map/reduce in Scala over Spark, and PIG; Select the proper language according to the problem to be solved using parallelism. Students also get knowledge to select a NoSQL DBMS for a specific purpose.\nRough Program: This module is composed in two parts., Part 1: Part one is related to parallel architectures proposed to handle high volumes of data. In this part we review parallel relational DBMS architectures first and then detail Hadoop and Spark architectures developed to analyse Big Data efficiently. We also review the main models used by NOSQL DBMS to handle large volumes of data which do not respect a specific schema., Several lab sessions are dedicated to the Hadoop ecosystem using the CDH distribution of Cloudera. Along these lab sessions students learn how to: Use the HDFS storage system of Hadoop as well as the Hive and Impala relational DBMS running over HDFS and which are good candidates to handle a large Data Warehouse; Build regular expressions, very useful to split unstructured data such as Log files in order to import them into structured relational tables in Hive, or to analyse them using Map/Reduce programs; Write Map/Reduce programs in Java, taking advantage of the Hadoop parallel architecture; Write Map/Reduce programs in Scala, a functional object oriented programming language allowing to write concise programs taking advantage of the Spark parallel architecture; Write Pig programs, Pig being a high level language generating Map/Reduce programs., Part 2: The second part is related to the optimization of multidimensional databases. The concepts of database indexing are studied through the most popular methods: BTree, B+Tree, Bitmap, Join indexes. The materialized views are also addressed in the specific context of a multidimensional database for speeding up the computation of query aggregations. Strategies to optimize a set of typical multi dimensional queries using these concepts are benchmarked on the SSB large database implemented on two major RDBMS, namely Oracle and SQL Server.\nEvaluation Method: Continuous assessment: a one week project for groups of two students and one evaluation evaluating each individual student.\nSpecific Course Rules: 3 absences in class = 0.\nCourse Material: Cours slides and Lab Sessions material available on cours.ut-capitole.fr, or exercise sheets distributed in class.\nBibliography Webography: Hadoop The Definitive Guide, Tom White, O'Reilly editions. http://bradhedlund.com/2011/09/10/understanding-hadoop-clusters-and-the-network/.
