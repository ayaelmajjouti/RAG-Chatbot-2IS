This part will first detail the functioning of artificial neural networks and inner mechanisms used to optimize synaptic weights. Practical sessions will be given in order to build deep neural networks to image analysis and to natural language processing. The framework Keras in Python will be used in this class. 2. Multiagent Simulations. We will introduce the modelling and simulation of complex systems (social systems in particular) using multi-agent simulation and will detail the main steps of this process, from data analysis, agent-based modelling, programing on a simulation platform (Netlogo or Gama), simulation exploration (using Open-mole) to the analysis of the results. The course will alternate theoretical approaches and practical issues. 3. Economics and Computation. We will introduce the main algorithms used in socio-economic activities, with a strong accent on those studied in the area of multiagent systems. The theoretical and practical aspects of these algorithms and mathematical models will be analysed.

  "course_description": "The internship is 5 months long, usually taking place from mid-March to the end of August. The Internship could be carried out in a company or a research laboratory. The internship is completed with a written report and an oral defense. The subject of the internship must be described precisely in the form of an internship proposal (organizational and technical context, objective, subject, approach to be followed and expected deliverables). It must be validated by the internship supervisor before signing an agreement and starting the internship. The internship will be assessed in two ways: - Content: this is mainly evaluated by the company/laboratory tutor. It includes the quality and difficulty of the assignment; - Reporting: this is mainly evaluated by the academic tutor. It consists of a report (dissertation) and an oral presentation in front of a jury (3 participants). In a company, the subject of the internship must include a substantial element of design and analysis, as well as an innovative part linked with the content of the 2IS master. The assignment should not be a simple execution, but should be a mission including the following activities: planning the mission, specifying the problem to be solved and its objective, designing a solution and implementing it. In a laboratory, the subject should be linked to innovative topics taught in 2IS (Sustainable Information System, Advanced Topics in AI, IoT, UIX, Data and Process Mining‚Ä¶). It should include research methods such as feasibility studies, comparative studies, surveys, formal models, simulation. Each year IRIT laboratory provides several internship proposals. During the professional week (November) meetings with companies and researchers are also organized to help students in their internship seeking.",
